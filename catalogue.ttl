    schema:description """This catalogue contains real place names whose information is formulated according to the candidate [ICSM Geographical Names Model](https://linked.data.gov.au/def/gn).

The purpose of this catalogue is to demonstrate the expressive power of that model and the presentation capabilities of the system that is being used to deliver this content online - the [Prez system](http://prez.dev).

Particular things to look out for demonstrations of in this catalogue ae:

1. Point, Line, Polygon and combined geometry use
    * current gazetteers are restricted to point locations only
2. Different forms of naming authority
    * formally (legally) gazetted names v. informal (community) names
3. Multi-lingual naming
    * English and non-English naming for the same object with the language indicated
4. Naming using the Compound Naming model and Geographical Object Categories
    * named objects are categorised according to the [Geographical Object Categories](https://linked.data.gov.au/def/go-categories) and the category is used in naming, unless deliberately overridden

Coming soon too:

x. Fuzzy Geometries
    * demo of a Geographical Name for an area with an imprecise location - a fuzzy geometry
